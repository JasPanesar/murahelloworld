# mura-dsphelloworld

This is an example 'hello world' display object for [Mura CMS](http://www.getmura.com) v7.

Also see [http://www.getmura.com/blog/mura-cms-7-new-display-object-conventions/](http://www.getmura.com/blog/mura-cms-7-new-display-object-conventions/) for more details about display objects in Mura 7.

## Please Note
This is intended for Mura CMS (v7+) training purposes only. It should **not** be used for production purposes.

This is the CFML branch of the [mura-dsphelloworld project](https://github.com/stevewithington/muracontacts/tree/cfml). It is intended to be an example of how a ColdFusion/CFML developer might approach creating an ultra-simple display object.
